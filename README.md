# climate-trends-prediction

This is a simple project that aims to predict the trends in temperature and rainfall in India over the past 100 years.
I have used linear and polynomial regression for this project.
This basic project can act as a foundation for further work in this field and people with extensive knowledge can apply it on this project.
